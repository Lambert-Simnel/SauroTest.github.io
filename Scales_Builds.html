<h2>Scales Builds</h2>
<p>The purpose of scales builds is to have GREAT SCALES.<br>
Generally any nation with a good gold to power ratio will enjoy scales.<br>
Sauromatia, which constantly wants to build forts and recruit Soothsayers, is such a nation.</p>

<h3>E3S6 Statue of Order</h3>

<p>Scales builf capable of making Matrices, Swords of Many Colors, and Rings.<br>
The Earth 3 gives access to Troll Kings and Astral 6 opens up many endgame options.

<h3>E4N2 Bull</h3>

<p>The purpose of SCALES BULL is to have LOTS OF SCALES.<br>
Mostly for fun because you'll get fucked late-game.</p>

<h3>W6E6 Wyrm</h3>
<img src="images/pretenders/W6E6_Wyrm.png" alt="W6E6 Wyrm" />
<p>W6E6 is a decent bless that will get you through the early game with Oiorpata,<br>
help you thug Warrior Sorceresses, and it can also cast Vengeful Waters later on.<br>
Need that L3 for Kirke.</p>

<h3>N9 Irminsul</h3>
<img src="images/pretenders/N9_Irminsul.png" alt="N9 Irminsul" />
<p>This pretender doesn't require much thinking.<br>
N9 give easy early expansion and can stay relevant later on with spells like Mother Oak, Enchanted Forests, and Gift of Reason. <br>
But it's mostly a cozy early game bless.
