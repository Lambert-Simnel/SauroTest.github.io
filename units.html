<h2>Units</h2>

<h3>Archer</h3>

<h4>Sauromatian Archer</h4>

<p>These are all you should believe in. Fuck everything else. Best ranged units in EA.<br>
As Sauromatia, you have the luxury of having absolutely no recruitable chaff.<br>
Ergo, place all of your archers on the frontlines and watch them die.<br>
Archers are best on Fire and Keep Distance. They will meet the enemy like the chaff they are,<br>
but will attempt to disengage and let longdead fill the front lines, lowering archer attrition.</p>

<h4>Androphag Archer</h4>

<p>Why would you pay more for chaff? Fucking useless.<br>
Their arrows deal poison damage if they hit.<br> 
I have yet to find a case where normal archers arent better.</p>

<h3>Infantry</h3>
<h4>Sauromatian Amazon</h4>

<p>Absolutely horrible line infranty. You are better just recruiting cataphrekt or lancers.<br>
They get beaten by raiders in almost every aspect.</p>

<h3>Charge Cavalry</h3>
<h4>Lancer</h4>

<p>Will rekt indies. Combine with Sauromatian Archers for expansion if youære running nobless.</p>


<h4>Sauromatian Cataphract</h4>

<p>Best cavalry of the age.<br> 
I hear of tactics where you line them infront of a row of soothsayers casting Body Ethereal to inflict some heavy damage.<br>
They are rather strong even without buffs and make excellent arrow catchers and flankers throughout the game.

<h3>Sacred Cavalry</h3>
<h4>Oiorpata</h4>
<img src="images/units/oiorpata.png" alt="Oiorpata" />
<p>Very good cavalry, but tends to cost more than it’s uses without a bless. <br>
Generally you should opt for the less gold hungry Cataphracts and spend more gold into building forts.</p>

<h4>Androphag</h4>
<img src="images/units/androphag.png" alt="Androphag" />
<p>70 gold for a lance is not worth it.</p>

<h3>Horse Archers</h3>
<h4>Sauromatian Raider</h4>
<img src="images/units/sauromatian_raider.png" alt="Sauromatian Raider" />

<p>A cheap blocker that can shoot arrows.<br>
Raiders are foreign rec, like chieftains. Combined with their MM3 they are easy to recruit and displace from any province you own.</p>

<h4>Sauromatian Lancer</h4>
<img src="images/units/sauromatian_lancer.png" alt="Sauromatian Lancer" />
<p>If you look closely you will see that the only difference between these and Sauromatian Raiders are their Light Lance.<br>
These are marginally better if you have high prod and more fort turns than you know what to do with, but the difference is minimal.</p>

<h3>Beasts</h3>
<p>Theoretically beasts against ELVES as their attacks are all magic, and their poison aura ignores glamour.</p>
