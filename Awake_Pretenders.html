<h2>Awake/Dormant Builds</h2>
<p>There are many reasons to go with a pretender who is not imprisonned.<br>
The first and most obvious is to have him conquer indies and get a lot of land early on in the game.<br>
Another is to have a very strong commander that can break into paths and kill armies alone.<br>
Another is a multi-pathed wizard that can help with research and search an incredible variety of sites.<br>
</p>

It also breaks into Earth, which is rather useful later on in the game.</p>
