<h1>Thugs and Super Combatants.</h1>

<p>As a top research nation with many good summons in conjuration, Sauromatia can expect to get a few of the elemental royalties.<br>
In this section we will go over how to make a cost-efficient thug, a strong super combatant, and the commanders that will fulfill those roles.<br>
However, for many of these, a pretender with paths will be needed.<p>
