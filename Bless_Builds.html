<h2>Scales Builds</h2>
<p>While Sauromatia might have great sacreds in the form of Oiorpata<br>
they are cap-only and the only sacreds worth using.<br>
If you don't defeat someone quickly and handedly at the beginning of the game, <br>
you won't be having a good time.</p>

<h3>W9N9 Volla of the Bountiful Forest</h3>

<p>W9N9 make Oiropata incredibly strong and very attrition resistant.<br>
You will have no problem expanding with 4-5 of these and can pump them out just as fast.</p>
