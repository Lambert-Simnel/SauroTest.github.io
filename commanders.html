<h3>Scout</h3>

<p>Sauromatia can get these in any province they own.<br>
Not because they are foreign-rec, but because you should have a fort on every province you own. </p>
<h3>Chieftain </h3>
<img src="images/commanders/chieftain.png" alt="chieftain"/>
<p>These are good only because they are foreign-rec MM3 commanders.<br>
In a tight spot you can get some to move around foreign-rec cavalry units. </p>
<h3>Sauromatian Manflayer </h3>
<img src="images/commanders/sauromatian_manflayer.png" alt="sauromatian_manflayer"/>
<p>Makes a decent commander.<br>
You’ll most likely go without ever recruiting one.<br>
This is because they require fort turns, and chieftains do not. </p>
<h3>Warrior Priestess </h3>
<img src="images/commanders/warrior_priestess.png" alt="warrior_priestess"/>
<p>As above makes a decent priest commander.<br>
You might want to recruit a few to build temples and bless Oiorpata.<br>
Later on you’ll want to to recruit indie priests for those jobs and for blood sacrificing.<br>
But for leading troops, Sauromatian Manflayers are simply better. </p>
<h3>Warrior Queen </h3>
<img src="images/commanders/warrior_queen.png" alt="warrior_queen"/>
<p>Makes a good leader.<br>
You don’t want any of these.  </p>
<h3>Hydra Tamer </h3>
<img src="images/commanders/hydra_tamer.png" alt="hydra_tamer"/>
<p>Don’t. </p>
