<h2>Mages</h2>
<br>

<h3>Soothsayer</h3>

<p id="handsome"> "He's so handome" - u</p>

<p>
As we can see, Soothsayers are not strictly mages! They don't have a full magic path.<br>
This means that they can be recruited like commanders, without the need of a lab.<br>
They do however come with astral 90% of the time, which is all but a guaranteed mage.<br>
Imagine that, being able to recruit mages without a lab. Soothsayers are amazing.<br>
<br>
So we don't need to waste as much money building labs as most nations do.<br>
We can use the gold to build more forts! So Sauromatia will have a lot of forts.<br>
Practically one on every province they own.<br>
<br>
This also means Sauromatia will have loads of low-level researchers; so make sure to take Magic scales.</p>

<ul>
	<li>No Astral</li>
</ul>
<p>These Soothsayers are nearly useless.<br>
If we are running L3, suicide them to reduce upkeep.<br>
If we are running Misf2, they can be used to lower risk of bad events as fortune tellers.</p>
<!-- Thanks moat -->
<ul>
	<li>Astral</li>
</ul>
<p>
While not the bread and butter of our army, they should be the bulk of our mages.<br>
The Soothsayers main evocation is Stellar Cascades. <br>
Have a master Soothsayer casting Light of the North Star with a clam to save on pearls.<br>
Placing Soothsayers with Enari and Witch Kings casting Body Ethereal will lower attrition.<br>
Cast Body Ethereal on Cataphracts to help repel a rush.

<h3>Spirit Guide</h3>

<br>
I know what you must be thinking.<br>
“Aren’t these just bad Enari?”<br>
<br>
Generally, I would agree.<br>
But y’see, late game can be suffering for the poor chaffless Sauromatian player.<br>
Large fights are easily found, and having tstrikes fuck you up at the beginning on the battle
is rather commonplace.<br>
<br>
So see here. Get around 8 of these and place place 4 right behind your main chaff line.<br>
At the beginning of battle have those 4 call wrath of ancestors and BAM 80 chaff turn 1.<br>
The other 4 are there to reinforce if these die. <br>
<br>
And they will die, but that’s fine; they only cost 45g.<br>
<br>
<br>
Besides that they can be used to craft skull talismans.<br>
Otherwise get Enari instead.


<h3>Enari</h3>
<img src="images/mages/enari.png" alt="Enari"/>
<p>n. Enari pl. Enari.</p>

<p>
Step 1: Place in a communion.<br>
Step 2: Spam Hordes of Skeletons.<br>
Step 3: ????<br>
Step 4: Victory.</p>

<h3>Warrior Sorceress</h3>
<img src="images/mages/warrior_sorceress.png" alt="Warrior Sorceress"/>
<ul>
	<li>Death Random</li>
</ul>
<p>The weakest of all possible paths.<br> 
Use these as temple-builders or expendable thugs.<br>
Soothsayers should be able to foresee this random.<br>
	And kill the sorceress in the womb.</p><br>
<ul>
	<li>Blood Random</li>
</ul>
<p>Stick a SDR on them and bloodhunt. Expensive, but worth it.
</p><br>
<ul>
	<li>Water Random</li>
</ul>
<p>This WS path makes the strongest thug, due to quicken self.<br>
Giving them a frost brand and casting quicken self will bump their<br>
Defence up to 27. With BE and Luck this makes for a rather strong light thug.<br>
They can also craft clams.</p><br>
<ul>
	<li>Nature Random</li>
</ul>
<p>This path gives you access to nature battlefield enchantments.<br>
Once owning a thistle mace an N2 WS will be able to cast<br>
Mass protection and mass regeneration and Howl.<br>
<br>
Before researching Wrath of the Ancestors, they can also cast swarm.<br>
Sauromatia is in dire need of chaff, so this spell finds uses in the midgame.<br>
Later on they can cast Storm of Thorns.</p>

<h2>Witch King</h2>
<img src="images/mages/witch_king.png" alt="Witch King"/>

<ul>
	<li>Death Random</li>
</ul>
<p>Big D. Used to cast the high-tier death spells.<br>
A death random Witch King with twiceborn can cast Tartarian Gate if<br>
they reanimated with an extra death path, given a Skull Staff and a Skull Helmet.<p><br>
<ul>
	<li>Blood Random</li>
</ul>
<p>Expensive blood hunting.<br>
Which you will do a lot of.
</p><br>
<ul>
	<li>Water Random</li>
</ul>
<p>Something more important than clams.<br>
But also clams.</p><br>
<ul>
	<li>Nature Random</li>
</ul>
<p>Ratcheting up to those nature globals<br>
<br>
In particular:<br>
N2 WK + Thistle Mace + Armor of Twisting Thorns<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
= N4 WK + Ivy King<br>
N1S1 Enari + Armor of Twisting Thorns + Thistle Mace<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
= N3S1 Enari + Moonvine Bracelet<br>
N3 Ivy King + Moonvine Bracelet + Thistle Mace + Armor of Twisting Thorns <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
= N6 Ivy King + GoH<br>
<br>
However this can all be circumvented by rolling Sauromatias N4 hero Kirke, or an awake N4 pretender.</p>

<p>In all cases the Witch Kings will be the leaders of our troops.</p>

<h5 style="color:gray;">On the Witch King thug.</h5>
<p>I try telling people about the Witch King thug.<br>
They keep going on about how it's a meme, that it will never work.<br>
Telling me that a Witch King is better served on the back lines spamming skeletons.<br>
But I’ll show them. I’ll show them all the power of the Witch King thug.<br>
<br>
The idea is to use D4 WKs as thugs, so when they die the 25% of them that become D5 will be able to cast Tartarian Gate.</p>
