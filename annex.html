<h1>Annex/Terminology Repository</h1>
<hr>
<h3>PotNS</h3>
<p>Portmanteau for casting Light of the Northern Star and Power of the Spheres together.</p>


<h3>Effective Fort Cost</h3>
<p>The cost necessary to make a useful fort.<br>
Most nations require a lab to make their forts useful.<br>
Some nations require only a temple, such as mictlan.<br>
Other nations require both a temple and a lab in their forts,<br>
making their Effective Fort Cost very high.<br>
<br>
Sauromatia needs neither a lab nor a temple to make soothsayers.<br>
This means that their effective fort cost is rather low.<br>
Excellent reason to spam forts on every province you own.</p>


<h3>Terminology for Scaling Spells</h3>
<p>When an Y pathed spell is marked as having M+ effects, this is to mean<br>
that the spell will have an extra effect for every path the casting mage has above Y.<br>
Similarly M++ gives an extra two effects.<br>
<br>
For example, Horde of Skeletons is a D2 spell which summons 6+ skeletons.<br>
So an Enari that's currently at D4 will summon 8 skeletons with every cast of Horde of Skeletons.</p>


<h3>Screening</h3>
<p>Say someone is digging into your territory with some big bad.<br>
They only have so many gems on them.<br>
<br>
To whittle down on their supply you send one of your immortal vampires to fight them with some blood slaves.<br>
This will trigger all their gem usage lowering their magical strength for upcoming battles.

This is screening.</p>
<h3>Communions</h3>
<p>On communions.
Sauromatia is a nation of communion.<br>
The largest communion you should consider is formed by 9 Enari Masters and 4 Enari slaves.<br>
Given a soothsayer castin’ Power of the Spheres, the slaves will have more spell paths than the casting <br>masters, thus fatigue is cut in half. This will have the slaves incurring 1 fatigue per spell cast, <br>
even in drain 2, which is enough to last a battle.<br>
<br>
Note: Communion Slaves and Master can be at any distance of each other, anywhere on the battlefield.<br>
Similarly for Sabbath Slaves and Masters. Interestingly, Blood Slaves as well follow this rule.<br>
A blood mage may use friendly slaves from within 8 squares inclusive on the battlefield, even those he does not hold.<br>
<br>
<br>
Natural order of Enari artillery should be:
	<ol>
		<li>2 Soothsayer / 2 Enari Turbo Comm
			<ul><li>Fatigue per Turn: Turbo Stable.</li></ul></li>
		<li>4 Enari / 5 Enari Comm
			<ul><li>Fatigue per Turn: 12</li></ul></li>
		<li>2 Enari / 5 Enari (+ 2 Soothsayer) PotNS Comm
			<ul><li>Fatigue per Turn: 12</li></ul></li>
		<li>4 Enari / 10 Enari (+ 2 Soothsayer) PotNS Comm
			<ul><li>Fatigue per Turn: 10</li></ul></li>
		<li>4 Enari / 12 Enari (+ 2 Soothsayer, + 1 Witch King) PotNS Relief Comm
			<ul><li>Fatigue per Turn: 11.5 (Have the Witch King cast reinvigorate)</li></ul></li>
	</ol>
Clammed Soothsayers should be given bows and set on fire so the slaves don't incur fatigue from cascade spam.

</p>

<h3>Turbo Communions</h3>

<p>Once communion slaves hit the 200 fatigue point they start taking damage at a rate of 1hp for every 50 points of fatigue, rounded up.<br> 
Normally in a stable communion you want to keep this off for as long as possible, by finding ways of lowering the fatigue and increasing the slaves reinvigoration.<br> 
<br>
However sometimes you can just say fuck it, and take the blows. These are turbo communions.<br> 
The point of a turbo communion is for your slaves to regenerate HP faster than they get damaged from spellcasting fatigue.<br> 
<br>
Now consider this setup:<br>
2 Enari as masters, and 2 Soothsayers as slaves.<br> 
Every Horde of Skeletons cast will put back each slave by 28 points of fatigue.<br> 
In only 4 turns the slaves will be at 200 fatigue, not ideal.<br> 
However if you enlarge the slaves and cast personal regen on the master, the slaves will be healing 2hp per turn, as many hit points as there are masters.<br> 
This means the communion is “turbo stable” and will last the duration of the fight.<br> 
Care must be taken as the Enari casting enlarge must be in the same square as the two soothsayers.<br>
<br>
A turbocomm with 40 archers is able to kill bogarus and co.</p>

<h4>TurboRaid</h4>
<p>A raiding party that consists of a turbo communion and a small squad of Cataphracts or Archers.</p>

<h3>Super Huge Communions</h3>
<p>A super big communion is defined as a communion that's huge, like xbox huge.<br>
We will consider 4+/16+ enari communions, generating 120+ skeletals per turn.<br>
Let's go over the main ingredients for this recipe.<br>
<ul>
	<li>1 Soothsayer casting PotS, then Fire Closest with a Black Bow of Botulf..</li>
	<li>1 Earth Indie casting Earthpower(+4 reinvig), then Fire Closest with a Black Bow of Botulf.</li>
	<li>A massive number of Enari.</li>
	<li>A nature random Witch King casting Relief(+2.5 reinvig), hold, hold, hold, Reinvigorate, then Cast Spells.</li>
</ul>

Let R = # of masters - Total Expected Reinvig + {# of Witch Kings if # of Slaves < 6}<br>
The number of turns a large communion can stand is expected to be (100/R)+(100/(R-5))+5<br>
With the notable expection that if R &le; 0 then the communion is fatigue-stable.<br>
An example of a Super Big Communion would be a 4/16 core communion with 1 Soothsayer, 1 Witch King, and one Witch.<br>
In this case R = 16 - 6.5 + 1 = 10.5. So the communion will last an expected (100/10.5)+(100/(10.5-5))+5 = 32 turns.<br>
That is, this communion will cast 137 longdead every turn for 32 turns.<br>
<br>
The research required for this is Const4, Ench6, Conj3 and Thaum1. So early midgame.</p><br>
